      "question": "Rank the species below in order of increasing nucleophilicity in hydroxylic solvents:\na) CH₃COO⁻\nb) CH₃S⁻\nc) OH⁻\nd) H₂O",
      "answers": {
        "a": "c < a < d < b",
        "b": "d < a < c < b",
        "c": "a < b < c < d",
        "d": "b < a < d < c"
      },
      "explanations": {
        "a": "This option implies CH₃S⁻ is the most nucleophilic, which is generally true in protic solvents.",
        "b": "This option suggests water is the least nucleophilic.",
        "c": "Incorrect order; H₂O is generally less nucleophilic than OH⁻.",
        "d": "Incorrect; CH₃COO⁻ is less nucleophilic than CH₃S⁻ or OH⁻."

      "question": "Which of the following compounds is most nucleophilic?",
      "answers": {
        "a": "CH₃OH",
        "b": "CH₃COOH",
        "c": "CH₄",
        "d": "H₂O"
      },
      "explanations": {
        "a": "Methanol has lone pairs but is less nucleophilic due to hydrogen bonding.",
        "b": "Acetic acid is weakly nucleophilic due to resonance stabilization.",
        "c": "Methane is not nucleophilic; it lacks lone pairs.",
        "d": "Water is more nucleophilic than alcohol in many cases due to less steric hindrance."
