### Procedure


<ol>
  <li>
    To a solution of isatin (500 mg, 3.39 mmol) in dry DMF (10 mL) was added powdered calcium hydride (472 mg, 11.21 mmol), and the mixture was stirred with gentle warming (40–50°C) for half an hour.
  </li>
  <li>
    The allylating agent (16.99 mmol) was added to the reaction mixture at room temperature and stirred for 4–5 hours.
  </li>
  <li>
    The reaction mixture was then poured slowly into a neutralized solution of brine.
  </li>
  <li>
    The organic layer was extracted using ethyl acetate several times.
  </li>
  <li>
    Evaporation of the solvent left a residue, which was then subjected to chromatography on a silica gel column using an 80:20 hexane:ethyl acetate solvent mixture to afford the N-allyl derivative of isatin.
  </li>
</ol>
