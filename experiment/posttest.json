      "answers": {
        "a": "Inversion of configuration",

      "explanations": {
        "a": "SN2 reactions involve backside attack, leading to inversion.",
        "b": "Incorrect; inversion dominates.",
        "c": "SN1 reactions may show slight inversion or retention, but not SN2.",
        "d": "Incorrect; SN2 causes inversion."
